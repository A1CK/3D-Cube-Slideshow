CSS 3D Presentation Framework

-----------------------------

Intended for personal/limited use -- there are no current plans for support or feature additions at this time.
Tested in latest Chrome and Safari only.

-----------------------------

Important Note: 

Due to a webkit bug, matrix rotation of a cube construct sometimes causes loss of 
interactivity with portions of each "face" of the cube (but strangely, not the entirety of a face).
To get around this in the short term, I simply clone the contents of each face and apply them to a 
"screen" element that sits in front of the cube-set.

Many limitations of the presentation framework are a result of this hacky fix, so if anyone figures
out how to prevent the loss of interactivity, be sure to do a pull request.


-----------------------------

Usage:

The arrow links on each face can be used to navigate a slideshow. Keyboard controls are preferred, and
can be used as follows:

Space:				advance to next face (or next cube if on the last face of current cube)
Delete:				return to previous face (or previous cube if on first face of current cube)
Arrow keys:			rotate forward, backward, left, and right
Home/End: 			rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise
Page Up/Page Down:	next/previous cube
Number keys (1-6):	rotate to numbered face of current cube
